### About Me: 
I am not a developer yet, but I have a strong will to become a professional one day. 
I believe that if you really want something you surely get. My previous life expierence and my job as a salesman teached me a lot.
 So now I have a confidence in my purpose and my abilities. And the only thing I need is time, to study a lot of difficult materials and learn how to use it in real life.
